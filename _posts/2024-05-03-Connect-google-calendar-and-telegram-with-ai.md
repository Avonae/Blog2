I'm using telegram and google calendar on daily basis. That post about connecting them together with simply AI to make your life easier.

I'm not a fan of productivity - honestly, this trend seems quite crazy to me. However, I do love convenience and things that simplify my life.

Most often, I use 3 services:

Telegram - I practically live in it. Messaging with colleagues, friends, and channels - that's my everything.
Google Calendar - for work tasks and personal meetings, to which I invite other people.
Todoist - for storing tasks that require periodicity, and I unload tasks from my mind there.
The last 2 services are integrated with each other, and tasks created in Todoist are synced with Google Calendar and vice versa. It's quite convenient because on my phone, notifications are disabled for practically all applications except Google Calendar and Telegram.

I've been thinking about managing the calendar through Telegram, but all I found was the integration of Telegram + Todoist through IFTTT, which I didn't like. And recently, I found a solution that I still use - Dola.ai.

Dola.ai is a service that connects to the calendar and allows you to modify meetings via Telegram. You can write to it (for some reason, I think Dola is feminine), "Tomorrow at 11:00 meeting with the client," and it will schedule the meeting for 11 in the morning. But that's not the coolest part - you can also say it out loud. And it's damn convenient, for example, while you're driving somewhere, you can tell it what meetings to create, which ones to cancel, and it will do everything.

I'm very pleased, I recommend it.
